h1. Notification Control

This Redmine plugin lets you configure for each project/tracker-combination which field changes result in a notification.

h2. Installation

# Copy the notification_control plugin to your redmine plugin directory (vendor/plugins)
# Apply the Database Schema Migration file (20100728100000_create_notification_controls.rb) by using the following command: rake db:migrate_plugins
# Restart any running Redmine application servers
# Configure the notification settings per project as desired

h2. Usage

# By default, the plugin does not change the behavior of redmine at all, meaning that notifications are sent as usual.
# Settings for notifications are made on project level. This means that you need to switch to a project, so that you can click the new "Notification" tab
# For each tracker in a project you can check the fields that should result in a e-mail notification, if their value gets changed.
# Use the "Save" button to store your settings.
# If you uncheck all checkboxes for a project, this means that no notifications will be sent for this project.
# If you check all the checkboxes for a project, notifications will be sent as if there was no plugin installed.

h2. TODO

Check compatibility with different versions of redmine and different database systems. This plugin was developed for "Redmine 0.9.3.stable (MySQL)".
